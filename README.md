# UFOs
Overview:
This data analysis was completed on UFO sightings. UFO sightings were made available through a website. This website has a table with data stored in JavaScript array. This table had filters so that users were able to type and filter data requests. The first filter was the date. After that filter was made into the table, the four other filters included city, state, country, and shape.

Results:
This is what the html page looks like:

When you look at the bottom of the webpage, the table with the filters are shown. There are a total of five filters available to search. When you type in a filter, you have to ensure you are spelling the words correctly with no spaces or special characters. When you type in one filter box, click away from the filter box and the results will show up to the right.

These are the table results when there are four filters applied.

Summary:
This webpage turned out to be visually appealing and was able to successfully filter five parts of data for UFO sightings. One drawback of this webpage is the date category. Although the date is a good feature to have, it may be hard for someone to remember the date of when a sighting was seen, in comparision to the city, state, country, and shape of the sighting.

Two recommendations I have for this webpage:
-Include a submit button so when the user is done typing in their filters, they can search for their results.
-Include a "Clear All" button. Then users can click this to erase all filters and start with blank filters for a new search.
